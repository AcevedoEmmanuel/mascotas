    <h1>MASCOTAS</h1>
    <P>In the shattered world of Elden Ring, the golden bands, symbols of divine order, lie shattered. The once-glorious realms are now consumed by the Erdtree's collapse, leaving chaos in its wake. Tarnished, a champion of no name, awakens to the Elden Ring's call, tasked with restoring the lost grace of the land. Guided by Grace, a mysterious figure, and facing demigods and ancient spirits, Tarnished must brave the Lands Between, unraveling its dark history and confronting the shattered remnants of a once-majestic world. In this land of tarnished glory, the fate of Elden Ring hangs in the balance.
